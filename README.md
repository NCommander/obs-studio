### FTL is now officially part of OBS!

From now on, thereâ€™s no need for a custom version of OBS to stream FTL. All future official releases of OBS have the ability to stream FTL out of the box! We recommend all streamers currently using OBS update to the official release of OBS to get the best stability and support.

### Download now!
The official build of OBS can be found on the official OBS website.

### Advantages of adding FTL to official OBS:
-	Record while streaming
-	Mac and Linux support
-	Signed OBS installers and game hooks
-	VCE support (the AMD encoder)
-	Support for the full OBS feature set
-	Official OBS updates
-	Official OBS support

### What will happen to this repo?
We will still produce builds of OBS-FTL every now and then as we work on new FTL features. We will release the new features in alpha test builds in this repo before we commit them to official OBS.
